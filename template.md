This template uses Google Cloud Run to deploy an AI model as a service. 
The AI model is packaged in a Docker container, which is stored in the Google Container Registry (gcr.io). 
The container runs a Python application (app.py) that exposes an HTTP endpoint for predicting retail costs.
The AI model is stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket (ai-bucket), which is created as a separate resource. 
The model file (model.h5) is uploaded to the bucket as a separate object (ai-model).

To deploy this template, you would need to replace my-project with your own Google Cloud project ID, 
and /path/to/model.h5 with the actual path to your AI model file. You would also need to authenticate with 
Google Cloud using the gcloud command-line tool, and set the default project using gcloud config set project <project-id>.
